Even for careers not directly within computer science.  Here is how I know this.</p> <p>I started working at Bell Labs in 1983 as a CMOS chip designer. Although I was right out of grad school, I was already a proficient C programmer. This was somewhat unique in 1983. I worked at the Bell Labs Allentown facility where they designed and built digital signal processors installed in telephone switching equipment. I was one of the first people hired in Allentown who could write code. Within 18 months, I had written C programs that saved their drafting staff thousands of hours of time manually laying out repetitive chip masks.</p>"},{"location":"about/#kr","title":"K&amp;R","text":"<p>I was fortunate to lead efforts to move from fixed placement design to symbolic design, where chip designers just specified the high-level topology of a circuit and let design automation tools handle the rest. The person I chose to work with was none other than the famous Brian Kernighan. Brian is the \"K\" in the famous \"K&amp;R\" book, which became one of the most popular programming books of all time.</p> <p></p> <p>Brian was also the coauthor of the \"awk\" language.  He is the \"K\" in \"awk\". Brian suggested I work with him on a custom version of awk to generate symbolic layout for integrated circuits. This new language, called <code>awk-i</code>, became a central tool for our chip designers. I wrote hundreds of UNIX shell scripts that automated many parts of the process of designing, simulating, and generating all the layers of polygons used to create the masks used to build the chips. The productivity gains were dramatic. And to put this all into context, my shell scripts ran on a VAX 11/780 with a total of 2 megabytes of RAM.</p> <p>Although I was lucky to be taught UNIX by the masters, another fortunate aspect was that almost every job I had in my career of nearly 40 years involved using UNIX and Linux. I can honestly say that knowing my way around the shell was key to advancing my career at every stage.</p>"},{"location":"about/#linux-and-shell-in-the-age-of-ai","title":"Linux and Shell in the Age of AI","text":"<p>When ChatGPT came out in November of 2022, I knew that the world of coding would change forever. I thought that knowing Linux and shell coding might no longer be needed. But I was wrong. In March of 2025, Anthropic announced the revolutionary Claude Code. Here was the catch: Claude Code was built entirely around running shell commands! Every create, copy, and move was a shell command. When you watch Claude Code work, you are watching a series of shell commands running on your local computer.</p> <p>What I can also tell you is that competing operating systems like Windows increasingly must support Linux through tools like the Windows Subsystem for Linux. Tools like Claude Code have a much harder time working with obscure variations of command-line interfaces such as <code>PowerShell</code>, which only runs on Windows. Today, over 95% of servers in the datacenter run Linux, not Windows. If you want your tools to run everywhere, the Linux shell is really the only realistic option.</p>"},{"location":"about/#linux-continues-to-evolve","title":"Linux Continues to Evolve","text":"<p>Today, if you follow the hundreds of thousands of people who contribute to the Linux code base and its related tools, you see that it is not a static operating system. Many younger Rust developers are realizing that running Linux on 128 cores is a lot more complicated than the original VAX 11/780 with a single CPU that I worked on back in 1983.</p> <p>How Linux will be built a few years from now is difficult to predict. But what I can tell you is that knowing what the <code>ls</code>, <code>cp</code>, and <code>mv</code> commands do will be with us for a long time! It is my sincere hope that this becomes the best intelligent textbook to help you on your journey to becoming a Linux master.</p> <p>Best of luck to you in your career!</p> <p>Dan McCreary - LinkedIn December 2025</p>"},{"location":"contact/","title":"Contact","text":"<p>Please contact me on LinkedIn</p> <p>Thanks! - Dan</p>"},{"location":"course-description/","title":"Learning Linux Course Description","text":"<p>Title: Learning Linux Length: 15-week semester long course Audience: High school students Course Description Quality Score: 91/100 (Excellent)</p>"},{"location":"course-description/#prerequisites","title":"Prerequisites","text":"<ul> <li>Students must have strong typing skills including the use of the copy/cut and paste commands.</li> <li>Students should have access to a Linux terminal shell.

This was a device that could compete with some of the best desktop computers. And the nice thing about the 500+ was that it had all the hardware ports for connecting it to thousands of sensors and motors to control lab equipment in schools.</p> <p>However, the 500+ lacked one big component: A really fun book to teach kids how to use the powerful Linux operating system that powered the 500+.</p> <p>To put this in context, this was just around the time that Anthropic Claude Code Skills were taking off.  And Claude Code was build around what core skill?  If you guess Linux shell commands you were RIGHT!.

Bell Labs was basically the Hogwarts of technology\u2014researchers there invented transistors, lasers, information theory, and yes, UNIX. If you wanted to work on cool stuff that would change the world, Bell Labs was THE place to be.</p> <p>Fun Fact</p> <p>Bell Labs scientists have won 9 Nobel Prizes! That's more than most entire countries.</p> <p>In 1969, two brilliant programmers named Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie were feeling grumpy. They had been working on a project called Multics (a complicated operating system that was... well, complicated), and it wasn't going well. The project got cancelled, and Ken was especially bummed because he'd been playing a video game called \"Space Travel\" on the Multics system, and now he had nowhere to play it!</p> <p>So what did Ken do?

Our team shared a file system that was always running out of space and causing problems. We were spending a large part of our team meetings trying to manage the disk space. One day I got tired of all the drama and sat down and wrote a program that created a Big-old-file scorecard.  It didn't just find the largest files or the oldest files.  It created a weighted score that combined these two numbers.  Our meetings were much more productive and we could then automate the process of automatically deleting big old files on a regular basis.</p> <p>What I learned is that teams that manage resources need great tools to find specific files and then do tasks like compress, archive or delete old files.</p>"},{"location":"chapters/17-compression-search/#find-it-and-squeeze-it","title":"Find It and Squeeze It!","text":"<p>Ever wondered how to find that one config file you edited three weeks ago somewhere in your home directory?

This frees the CPU from interrupt handling and data shuffling, dramatically improving performance when using multiple peripherals simultaneously. It's why the Pi 5 can transfer files at full NVMe speed while still being responsive for other tasks.</p> What voltage do Raspberry Pi GPIO data pins operate at, and why is this important? <p>Raspberry Pi GPIO data pins operate at 3.3V logic levels. This is critically important because connecting 5V directly to a GPIO data pin will permanently damage the Raspberry Pi. When using 5V sensors or modules (common with Arduino), you must use level shifters or choose 3.3V compatible components.</p> How do you set up SSH and WiFi before the first boot using Pi Imager? <p>In Pi Imager, after selecting your OS and storage, click the gear icon (\u2699\ufe0f) to access Advanced Options. Here you can enable SSH (and optionally set an authorized key), configure WiFi with your network name and password, set a username and password, and configure locale settings. This allows you to boot the Pi \"headless\" and connect remotely without ever connecting a monitor.</p> Why might a $300 Raspberry Pi 500 with 16GB RAM replace a traditional desktop for many users? <p>The Pi 500 provides sufficient power for common tasks like web browsing (including dozens of tabs), office work (LibreOffice, Google Docs), programming (VS Code, Python, Node.js), and media streaming (4K YouTube, Netflix). The RP1 I/O chip ensures responsive performance by offloading peripheral handling from the CPU. Combined with an NVMe SSD, it offers fast boot times and snappy application launches. For students, casual users, and Linux learners, it provides everything needed at a fraction of desktop computer costs.</p> What is the difference between the Camera Serial Interface (CSI) and a USB webcam? <p>The CSI port provides a dedicated high-bandwidth connection directly to the Pi's GPU, enabling hardware-accelerated video encoding and efficient processing. USB webcams share bandwidth with other USB devices and require more CPU overhead for processing. CSI cameras offer lower latency, higher frame rates, and less CPU usage, making them ideal for video projects, machine learning applications, and time-lapse photography.</p>"},{"location":"chapters/19-raspberry-pi/#chapter-summary","title":"Chapter Summary","text":"<p>You've just learned about one of the most important tools in your Linux journey\u2014the Raspberry Pi!

The ratio of on-time to total time (duty cycle) controls the average power delivered. At 50% duty cycle, an LED appears half as bright and a motor runs at half speed. PWM is useful because GPIO pins can only output full on (3.3V) or full off (0V)\u2014PWM creates the illusion of intermediate values by switching so fast that our eyes/motors perceive an average.</p> Why must you use a motor driver instead of connecting motors directly to GPIO pins? <p>Motor drivers are required for two reasons: (1) Motors need more current than GPIO pins can safely provide\u2014GPIO pins can supply only a few milliamps, while motors need hundreds of milliamps to amps. (2) Motors generate voltage spikes when starting/stopping that can damage the Pi. Motor drivers isolate the Pi from these high currents and spikes while allowing GPIO signals to control motor direction and speed.</p> How does MQTT work, and why is it popular for IoT applications? <p>MQTT uses a publish/subscribe model with a central broker. Publishers send messages to named topics (like \"home/temperature\"), and subscribers receive messages from topics they're interested in. The broker routes messages between them. It's popular for IoT because: (1) It's extremely lightweight\u2014ideal for low-power devices, (2) It handles unreliable networks gracefully with QoS levels, (3) The pub/sub model decouples senders from receivers, making systems flexible and scalable.</p> What makes NeoPixel LEDs different from regular RGB LED strips? <p>NeoPixel (WS2812B) LEDs are individually addressable\u2014each LED has its own tiny controller chip that receives color data. This means you can control every single LED independently with different colors, using only one data wire. Regular RGB strips are analog: all LEDs share the same control, so the entire strip shows one color. NeoPixels enable complex patterns, animations, and effects that would be impossible with analog strips.</p> What is Thonny and why is it well-suited for GPIO and MicroPython programming? <p>Thonny is a beginner-friendly Python IDE that comes pre-installed on Raspberry Pi OS. It's well-suited for GPIO and MicroPython programming because: (1) It has a simple, uncluttered interface, (2) The built-in debugger lets you step through code line by line, (3) The variable inspector shows sensor values updating in real-time, (4) It can connect directly to MicroPython devices (Raspberry Pi Pico, ESP32), letting you write code on your Pi and run it on microcontrollers. This makes it perfect for learning and debugging hardware projects.</p>"},{"location":"chapters/20-gpio-iot/#chapter-summary","title":"Chapter Summary","text":"<p>Congratulations!

Each VM requires its own OS installation, which takes gigabytes of space and seconds to minutes to boot. Containers share the host's kernel and only package the application and its dependencies, making them much smaller (megabytes) and faster to start (milliseconds). VMs provide stronger isolation but more overhead; containers are more efficient but share more with the host.</p> What is the purpose of a Dockerfile, and what are the key instructions? <p>A Dockerfile is a text file containing instructions to build a Docker image. Key instructions include: FROM (base image), WORKDIR (set working directory), COPY (copy files into image), RUN (execute commands during build), EXPOSE (document ports), ENV (set environment variables), and CMD (default command to run). The Dockerfile creates a reproducible, versioned way to package applications.</p> How does Docker Compose simplify running multi-container applications? <p>Docker Compose uses a YAML file (docker-compose.yml) to define multiple services, networks, and volumes in one place. Instead of running multiple <code>docker run</code> commands with complex options, you run <code>docker compose up</code> to start everything. Compose handles container ordering (depends_on), networking (containers can reach each other by service name), shared volumes, and consistent configuration. This makes development environments reproducible and simplifies local testing of microservices.</p> What is Infrastructure as Code, and why is Terraform useful for cloud deployments? <p>Infrastructure as Code (IaC) means defining your infrastructure (servers, networks, databases) in configuration files rather than manually creating them through web consoles. Terraform is useful because: (1) configurations can be version-controlled in Git, (2) the same config always creates the same infrastructure (reproducibility), (3) changes can be reviewed before applying, (4) infrastructure can be created, updated, and destroyed with simple commands, and (5) it works across multiple cloud providers with the same language.</p> What are container volumes, and why are they necessary for databases? <p>Container volumes provide persistent storage that survives container restarts and removal. By default, all data inside a container is lost when the container is deleted. Databases need volumes because they store data that must persist\u2014without a volume, all your database records would be lost every time you restart the container. Volumes can be named (managed by Docker) or bind mounts (mapped to host directories).</p>"},{"location":"chapters/21-cloud-containers/#chapter-summary","title":"Chapter Summary","text":"<p>You've just leveled up from running Linux on single machines to orchestrating infrastructure across the globe!

Understanding this workflow helps you track which changes are ready to be saved and which are still in progress.</p> What is the difference between git fetch and git pull? <p>git fetch downloads changes from the remote repository but doesn't merge them into your local branch - it just updates your remote-tracking branches. git pull does both: it fetches changes AND automatically merges them into your current branch. Use fetch when you want to see what changed before merging, and pull when you're ready to integrate the changes immediately.</p> Why should you use virtual environments for Python projects? <p>Virtual environments isolate each project's dependencies from the system Python and from other projects. Without them, you might have conflicts where Project A needs Django 3.0 but Project B needs Django 4.0 - you can only have one version installed globally. With virtual environments, each project has its own isolated Python with its own packages, so they never conflict.</p> What is the purpose of SSH keys for GitHub, and how do they work? <p>SSH keys provide secure, password-less authentication to GitHub. You generate a key pair (private and public), add the public key to your GitHub account, and keep the private key on your computer. When you push or pull, SSH uses your private key to prove your identity. This is more secure than passwords and more convenient since you don't need to enter credentials for every operation.</p> What is the difference between print debugging and using a debugger like pdb? <p>Print debugging adds print statements to show variable values and execution flow - it's simple but requires modifying code and rerunning. A debugger like pdb lets you pause execution at any point, inspect all variables, step through code line by line, and even change values mid-execution without modifying the source code. Debuggers are more powerful but have a learning curve; print debugging is quick for simple issues.</p>"},{"location":"chapters/22-dev-tools/#chapter-summary","title":"Chapter Summary","text":"<p>You're now equipped with the essential tools of a professional developer!

You've made it to the chapter where you get to feel like you're running the show. System administration (or \"sysadmin\" work, as the cool kids call it) is all about keeping Linux systems running smoothly, managing users, controlling services, and generally being the person everyone calls when something breaks.</p> <p>Here's a little secret about being a sysadmin: it's often a thankless job. When everything is working perfectly, nobody notices. Your servers are humming along, users are happy, and you might as well be invisible. But the moment one disk fills up at 3 AM? Your phone will light up like a Christmas tree with panicked messages. The secret to being a great sysadmin is writing tools to monitor your resources before they cause problems. Trust me on this one\u2014proactive monitoring beats emergency firefighting every single time.</p> <p>Think of yourself as the wizard behind the curtain, pulling the levers that make the whole system work.

Who gets to use the system? What can they access? Can they install software or are they limited to just browsing cat pictures? These are the questions you'll be answering.</p> <p>Linux is a multi-user operating system, meaning multiple people can use the same computer (either at different times or even simultaneously over a network). Each user has their own account, home directory, and set of permissions. It's like an apartment building where everyone has their own unit, and you're the building manager.</p>"},{"location":"chapters/23-sys-admin/#creating-users-with-useradd","title":"Creating Users with useradd","text":"<p>The <code>useradd</code> command creates new user accounts.

It's like setting up a new tenant with their apartment, mailbox, and building access card all at once!</p> <p>Pro Tip: adduser vs useradd</p> <p>On Debian-based systems (including Raspberry Pi OS and Ubuntu), you might also see <code>adduser</code>, which is a friendlier wrapper around <code>useradd</code> that prompts you for information interactively.
