Although this is just one announcement in a long line of Raspberry Pi products, the features and performance of the 500+ was stunning.  But this was not just for the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) crowd.  This was a device that could compete with some of the best desktop computers. And the nice thing about the 500+ was that it had all the hardware ports for connecting it to thousands of sensors and motors to control lab equipment in schools.</p> <p>However, the 500+ lacked one big component: A really fun book to teach kids how to use the powerful Linux operating system that powered the 500+.</p> <p>To put this in context, this was just around the time that Anthropic Claude Code Skills were taking off.  And Claude Code was build around what core skill?  If you guess Linux shell commands you were RIGHT!.  In summary, I realized we could combine the need for Linux education with Claude Code to build a really fun world-class textbook targeting high-school students that would empower them with the knowledge they need to use these powerful tools.</p>"},{"location":"course-description/#why-this-course-is-different","title":"Why this Course is Different","text":"<p>If you do a Google Search, you can find hundreds of books on UNIX and Linux going back to the 1980s.

Real Computing Power for Modern Curriculum</p> <p>The Pi 500+ is no longer a \"toy\" computer:   - 16GB RAM handles VS Code, multiple browser tabs, and development environments   - 256GB NVMe SSD provides fast boot times and ample storage for projects   - Dual 4K display support enables professional-grade visual work   - Runs full Raspberry Pi OS (Debian-based Linux), Python, Scratch, and web development tools</p> <p>This makes it suitable for teaching:   - Linux system administration   - Python programming   - Web development (HTML/CSS/JS, Node.js)   - Data science basics   - Robotics and physical computing (GPIO pins)</p> <p>### 3. Physical Computing Integration</p> <p>Unlike traditional PCs, the Pi 500+ retains the 40-pin GPIO header, enabling direct integration with:   - Sensors and actuators   - Robotics projects   - IoT experimentation   - Electronics prototyping</p> <p>Students learn both software AND hardware\u2014a unique advantage for STEM education.</p> <p>### 4. Durability and Maintenance</p> <ul> <li>Solid-state design with no moving parts (fanless operation)</li> <li>Lower power consumption (~15-27W vs. 200-500W for traditional PCs)</li> <li>Simple recovery\u2014reflash the SD card or reinstall on NVMe</li> <li>Reduced IT burden\u2014standardized, reproducible setups</li> </ul> <p>### 5. Considerations and Trade-offs</p> <p>According to https://www.tomshardware.com/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-500-plus-review, at $200, some may compare it   to budget laptops or Intel N100 mini PCs. However, the Pi 500+ offers:   - A complete keyboard-computer solution (no separate case/keyboard needed)   - GPIO for physical computing (unique advantage)   - Strong educational ecosystem and curriculum support   - Community and foundation resources</p> <p>Recommended Configurations for Schools</p> Use Case Model Per-Seat Cost Basic Linux/coding intro Pi 500 ($90) + monitor ~$170-250 Full STEM curriculum Pi 500+ ($220) + monitor ~$300-400 Budget-constrained Pi 4 (1GB) + peripherals ~$120-150 <p>## Conclusion</p> <p>The Raspberry Pi 500+ represents a significant milestone for affordable STEM education. At $200-220, schools can   deploy high-quality, capable Linux workstations that teach real-world skills\u2014from command-line proficiency to   physical computing\u2014at roughly 1/5 to 1/7 the cost of traditional PC labs. The inclusion of 16GB RAM, NVMe storage,   and mechanical keyboard transforms what was once a hobbyist device into a legitimate educational computing   platform.</p> <p>For high schools looking to expand STEM offerings without massive capital investment, the Pi 500 family offers an   unprecedented opportunity to democratize access to computing education.</p> <p>## Sources:   - https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/the-ultimate-all-in-one-pc-raspberry-pi-500-plus-on-sale-now-at-200/   - https://www.tomshardware.com/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-500-plus-review   - https://raspberrytips.com/raspberry-pi-500-plus-announced/   - https://opensource.com/article/18/3/computer-lab-school-raspberry-pi   - https://pidora.ca/transform-your-classroom-how-raspberry-pi-makes-stem-learning-come-alive/   - https://www.digikey.com/en/maker/blogs/2025/raspberry-pi-500-launches-with-256gb-nvme-ssd-and-16gb-ram</p>"}]}
