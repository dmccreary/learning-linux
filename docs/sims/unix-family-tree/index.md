# UNIX Family Tree

This interactive visualization shows how UNIX evolved from its origins at Bell Labs in 1969 into different branches including BSD, System V, and how Linux emerged as a separate but compatible system.

## About This Visualization

The UNIX operating system has one of the most influential family trees in computing history. From a single research project at Bell Labs, it spawned an entire ecosystem of operating systems that power everything from smartphones to supercomputers.

## Color Legend

| Color | Category | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Blue** | Original UNIX | The foundational UNIX created at Bell Labs |
| **Purple** | BSD Variants | Berkeley Software Distribution and derivatives |
| **Red** | System V | Commercial UNIX from AT&T and licensees |
| **Green** | GNU/Linux | Free and open-source GNU tools plus Linux kernel |

## Key Historical Events

### 1969: The Beginning
Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie created UNIX at Bell Labs. It introduced revolutionary concepts like hierarchical file systems, the C programming language, and the "everything is a file" philosophy.

### 1977: BSD Emerges
UC Berkeley created BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution), adding innovations like the vi editor, C shell, and crucially, the TCP/IP networking stack that would become the foundation of the internet.

### 1983: Two Major Forks
- **System V**: AT&T released their commercial UNIX standard
- **GNU Project**: Richard Stallman started the free software movement, creating tools that would later combine with Linux

### 1991: Linux Changes Everything
Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel. Combined with GNU tools, it created a complete free operating system that would eventually dominate servers, supercomputers, and mobile devices.

## Modern Descendants

- **macOS**: Apple's desktop OS, based on FreeBSD and the Mach kernel
- **Android**: Google's mobile OS, running on a modified Linux kernel
- **Ubuntu**: The most popular desktop Linux distribution
- **Red Hat Enterprise Linux**: The leading commercial Linux distribution

## Learning Objectives

After using this visualization, you should be able to:

- Identify the major branches of the UNIX family tree
- Explain how BSD and System V differ in their heritage
- Understand why Linux is "Unix-like" but not technically UNIX
- Recognize how modern operating systems trace their lineage to 1969

## How to Use

1. **Click** on any node to see detailed information about that operating system
2. **Hover** over nodes to highlight them
3. Use the **navigation buttons** to pan and zoom the diagram
4. Notice the **arrows** showing inheritance and influence between systems
