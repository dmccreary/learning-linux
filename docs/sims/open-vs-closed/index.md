## About This MicroSim

This interactive infographic helps students understand the fundamental differences between open source and proprietary software through visual comparison.

## How to Use

1. **Compare the columns**: The left (green) column shows open source characteristics, while the right (orange) column shows proprietary software characteristics.

2. **Hover over examples**: Move your mouse over the software examples (Linux, Firefox, Windows, Photoshop, etc.) to see a tooltip with more information about each.

3. **Click the button**: Press "What if you modify proprietary software?" to reveal what happens when you try to modify closed-source software (spoiler: lawyers get involved!).

## Key Concepts

### Open Source Software

- **Source code is available** for anyone to view
- **Modification is allowed** and encouraged
- **Sharing is permitted** under open licenses
- Examples include Linux, Firefox, VLC, and Blender

### Proprietary Software

- **Source code is secret** and protected
- **Modification is forbidden** by license agreements
- **Sharing may be illegal** without permission
- Examples include Windows, Photoshop, and Microsoft Office

## Learning Objectives

After using this MicroSim, students should be able to:

1. **Define** open source and proprietary software
2. **Identify** examples of each type
3. **Compare** the rights users have with each model
4. **Evaluate** the pros and cons of each approach

## Discussion Questions

1. Why might a company choose to make their software open source?
2. What are some advantages of proprietary software for users?
3. Can you think of situations where open source is better? Where proprietary is better?
4. How does the Linux operating system benefit from being open source?
