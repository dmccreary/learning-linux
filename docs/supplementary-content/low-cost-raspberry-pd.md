# Lowest-Cost Raspberry Pi Classroom Setup for Teaching Linux

  Here's a budget breakdown for the most affordable classroom setup:

  Option 1: Ultra-Budget (Pi Zero 2 W) — ~$45-50/student

  | Component
                                                                                 | Price (USD) |

                                                                                 | $15         |
  | microSD Card (32GB)
                                                                                 | $8-10       |
  | USB Power Supply (5V micro-USB)
                                                                                 | $8-10       |
  | USB Keyboard + Mouse Combo (e.g., https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Keyboard-Mouse-Combos-Under-25/s?keywords=Compu
  ter+Keyboard+%26+Mouse+Combos&rh=n:1194464,p_36:1253503011&c=ts&ts_id=1194464) | $15-20      |
  | USB OTG Hub (needed for Zero)
                                                                                 | $5-8        |
  | Total
                                                                                 | ~$45-50     |

  Note: The Pi Zero 2 W requires a micro-USB OTG adapter/hub to connect keyboard/mouse, which adds complexity and
  cost.

  Option 2: Recommended Budget (Pi 4 1GB) — ~$65-75/student

  | Component                                                 | Price (USD) |
  |-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
  | https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/                     | $35         |
  | microSD Card (32GB)                                       | $8-10       |
  | https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/type-c-power-supply/ | $8-12       |
  | USB Keyboard + Mouse Combo                                | $15-20      |
  | Total                                                     | ~$65-75     |

  Why Pi 4 is Better for Classrooms:

  - 4 USB ports (no adapter needed)
  - Dual monitor support
  - Runs full desktop Linux smoothly
  - Better for learning Python, VS Code, etc.
  - Supports many educational kits

  Monitor Consideration

  Both options assume students use existing monitors/TVs with HDMI. If you need monitors, add $80-150 each.

  Bottom Line

  - Absolute minimum: ~$45-50/student with Pi Zero 2 W
  - Practical minimum: ~$65-75/student with Pi 4 (1GB) — recommended for a real Linux learning experience
