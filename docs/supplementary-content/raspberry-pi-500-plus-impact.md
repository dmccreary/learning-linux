  ## Impact on High School STEM Labs

  ### 1. Dramatic Cost Reduction

  Traditional computer labs cost $800-1,500+ per workstation. A 25-seat STEM lab comparison:

  | Setup               | Cost per Seat | 25-Seat Lab Total |
  |---------------------|---------------|-------------------|
  | Traditional PC      | $1,000-1,500  | $25,000-37,500    |
  | Pi 500+ Desktop Kit | $220          | $5,500            |
  | Pi 500 Desktop Kit  | $120          | $3,000            |

  Schools can deploy a https://opensource.com/article/18/3/computer-lab-school-raspberry-pi using Raspberry Pi
  devices—a fraction of traditional costs.

  ### 2. Real Computing Power for Modern Curriculum

  The Pi 500+ is no longer a "toy" computer:
  - 16GB RAM handles VS Code, multiple browser tabs, and development environments
  - 256GB NVMe SSD provides fast boot times and ample storage for projects
  - Dual 4K display support enables professional-grade visual work
  - Runs full Raspberry Pi OS (Debian-based Linux), Python, Scratch, and web development tools

  This makes it suitable for teaching:
  - Linux system administration
  - Python programming
  - Web development (HTML/CSS/JS, Node.js)
  - Data science basics
  - Robotics and physical computing (GPIO pins)

  ### 3. Physical Computing Integration

  Unlike traditional PCs, the Pi 500+ retains the 40-pin GPIO header, enabling direct integration with:
  - Sensors and actuators
  - Robotics projects
  - IoT experimentation
  - Electronics prototyping

  Students learn both software AND hardware—a unique advantage for STEM education.

  ### 4. Durability and Maintenance

  - Solid-state design with no moving parts (fanless operation)
  - Lower power consumption (~15-27W vs. 200-500W for traditional PCs)
  - Simple recovery—reflash the SD card or reinstall on NVMe
  - Reduced IT burden—standardized, reproducible setups

  ### 5. Considerations and Trade-offs

  According to https://www.tomshardware.com/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-500-plus-review, at $200, some may compare it
  to budget laptops or Intel N100 mini PCs. However, the Pi 500+ offers:
  - A complete keyboard-computer solution (no separate case/keyboard needed)
  - GPIO for physical computing (unique advantage)
  - Strong educational ecosystem and curriculum support
  - Community and foundation resources

  Recommended Configurations for Schools

  | Use Case                 | Model                    | Per-Seat Cost |
  |--------------------------|--------------------------|---------------|
  | Basic Linux/coding intro | Pi 500 ($90) + monitor   | ~$170-250     |
  | Full STEM curriculum     | Pi 500+ ($220) + monitor | ~$300-400     |
  | Budget-constrained       | Pi 4 (1GB) + peripherals | ~$120-150     |

  ## Conclusion

  The Raspberry Pi 500+ represents a significant milestone for affordable STEM education. At $200-220, schools can
  deploy high-quality, capable Linux workstations that teach real-world skills—from command-line proficiency to
  physical computing—at roughly 1/5 to 1/7 the cost of traditional PC labs. The inclusion of 16GB RAM, NVMe storage,
  and mechanical keyboard transforms what was once a hobbyist device into a legitimate educational computing
  platform.

  For high schools looking to expand STEM offerings without massive capital investment, the Pi 500 family offers an
  unprecedented opportunity to democratize access to computing education.
