create a detailed description of a cover image for this course.  The image must be a wide-landscape image using a 
1.91:1 ratio to be used on a social media preview.  The title "Learning Linux" should be in the center in a white 
font on a dark background with padding.  Around the title is a montage collage of the images about the history and 
importance of Linux.  Add a logo of Bell Labs back in the 1980.  The collage should have images that are derived from
 the course description @docs/course-description.md 


## Result

Please generate a book cover image for a book on Learning Linux.

Wide landscape social media banner (1.91:1 ratio), dark slate gray center with "Learning Linux" in large white bold sans-serif text, surrounded by a montage collage of: vintage Bell Labs logo from 1980s, Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at terminal, Tux Linux penguin, Raspberry Pi 500 keyboard computer, terminal windows with green text, circuit boards, GPIO pins with LEDs, Docker whale, server racks, SSH network connections, code editor windows. Blue-indigo color tint overlay unifying all images, vignette effect darkening edges, professional tech education
aesthetic, high contrast, modern and retro elements blended

 ## Technical Image Specifications

  - Aspect Ratio: 1.91:1 (landscape)
  - Recommended Dimensions: 1200 x 628 pixels (standard social media preview)
  - Format: PNG or JPG

## Overall Composition

  The image is divided into a center title zone surrounded by a montage collage border featuring iconic imagery from
  Linux history and the course topics.

## Center Title Zone

Background: Dark slate gray (#1a1a2e) with subtle gradient darkening toward edges

  Title Treatment:
  - Text: "Learning Linux"
  - Font: Bold sans-serif (similar to Ubuntu or Source Sans Pro)
  - Color: Pure white (#FFFFFF)
  - Size: Large, prominently centered
  - Padding: A small amount dark space around text (approximately 3% margin on all sides)
  - Optional: Subtle drop shadow or glow for depth

##  Montage Collage Border

The collage surrounds the center title zone with overlapping, semi-transparent images at varying opacities (40-70%) to create depth without overwhelming the title. Images should have a slight blue/indigo tint overlay to unify the
color palette.

## Left Side - History & Origins

  1. Bell Labs Logo (1969-1983 era) - The iconic bell-in-circle logo representing where UNIX was born
  2. Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie - Black and white photo of the UNIX creators at a PDP-11 terminal
  3. Vintage terminal/teletype machine - Green phosphor CRT display showing command line
  4. The "C Programming Language" book cover - Kernighan & Ritchie's classic white book

  ## Top Section - Linux & Open Source

  5. Tux the Penguin - The Linux mascot, slightly stylized
  6. Linus Torvalds - Portrait or silhouette of the Linux creator
  7. GNU Logo - The wildebeest representing the GNU Project
  8. Binary code streams - Matrix-style falling 1s and 0s

  ## Right Side - Modern Applications

  9. Raspberry Pi 500+ device - The keyboard computer featured in the course
  10. GPIO pins and LED strips - Colorful electronics and maker projects
  11. Docker whale logo - Representing containers and cloud
  12. Server rack - Modern data center imagery
  13. Terminal window - Modern terminal showing colorful command output (ls, grep, etc.)

  ## Bottom Section - Hands-On Learning

  14. Circuit board patterns - Abstract PCB traces in green/gold
  15. SSH connection visualization - Network nodes connected by lines
  16. Code editor (VSCode) - Screenshot showing Python/shell script
  17. IoT sensors and devices - Temperature sensors, motors, home automation
  18. Cloud infrastructure icons - Terraform, AWS, abstract cloud shapes

##  Color Palette

  | Element             | Color            | Hex Code |
  |---------------------|------------------|----------|
  | Title background    | Dark slate       | #1a1a2e  |
  | Title text          | White            | #FFFFFF  |
  | Accent/overlay tint | Indigo           | #3F51B5  |
  | Secondary accent    | Raspberry Pi red | #C51A4A  |
  | Highlight           | Terminal green   | #00FF00  |
  | Warm accent         | Ubuntu orange    | #E95420  |

##   Visual Style Notes

  - Opacity layering: Background images at 30-50% opacity, mid-ground at 50-70%
  - Vignette effect: Darker edges drawing eye to center title
  - Unified color grading: Cool blue-indigo tint across all collage elements
  - Depth: Subtle parallax effect with larger images behind, smaller icons in front
  - Professional polish: Clean edges where collage meets title zone, possibly with soft fade


##   Symbolic Elements to Include

  1. Terminal prompt ($ or >) - Representing command-line interface
  2. Penguin silhouette - Linux identity
  3. Bell shape - Nod to Bell Labs origins
  4. Pi symbol (π) - Raspberry Pi reference
  5. Gear/cog icons - System administration
  6. Network topology lines - Connectivity and networking
