    screen, I can quickly tell how good their UNIX chops are just by looking at their prompts.
    If their prompts are the default prompts - long prompts with the full computer name like FredsMacBookPro.hsd1.mn.comcast.net, I know they might be rookies.  That prompt was long and not full of useful information. Also, if they have

    to find the Python src code they need to run.

    The tone should be enthusiastic and fun.  You can use your linux knowledge to 
    do many creative fun DIY projects at school or around your home.
    Please go into detail about how the Pi 5 has an entirely new chip dedicated to moving data around without bothering the CPU.  This chip has made the old anemic Pi 4 pale in comparison.  Note that a $300 Raspberry Pi 500+ with 16GB RAM is a replacement for even powerful desktop system.  Note that a great I/O chip makes even old CPUs look great!

    Note that system administration can be a thankless job.  Everyone is quite
    when things are working OK.  But if one disk gets full, the system breaks everyone will be
    texting your phone even if it is 3am!  The secret to a great system administrator
    is to write a lot of tools to monitor resources BEFORE the cause problems.  Trust me on this.
