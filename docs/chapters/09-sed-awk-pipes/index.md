# Advanced Text Processing: Sed, Awk, and Pipes

## Summary

This chapter covers advanced text processing with sed for stream editing and awk for field-based processing. You'll also master the UNIX philosophy in action: connecting commands with pipes, understanding text streams (stdin, stdout, stderr), and using redirection operators. These skills enable you to build powerful data processing pipelines.
