# GPIO Programming and Hardware Projects

## Summary

This chapter dives deep into hardware interfacing with the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins. You'll learn to control LEDs and NeoPixel strips, read sensors (temperature, motion, light), control motors (DC, servo, stepper), and build IoT projects. The chapter culminates in home automation concepts including Home Assistant, Node-RED, and remote monitoring dashboards.
