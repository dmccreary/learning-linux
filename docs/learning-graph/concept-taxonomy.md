## Category Descriptions

### HIST - History and Philosophy

Concepts covering the historical development of UNIX and Linux, key contributors like Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Richard Stallman, and Linus Torvalds, the UNIX philosophy of small modular tools, open source movement, and major Linux distributions.

### SHELL - Shell Fundamentals

Core concepts for working with the terminal including Bash and Zsh shells, command syntax, options and arguments, tab completion, command history, man pages, and basic system information commands.

### FSYS - File System

Everything related to navigating and manipulating files including the directory hierarchy, absolute and relative paths, file operations (copy, move, delete), file attributes, wildcards, and file globbing patterns.

### PERM - Permissions and Security

File permission system including read/write/execute permissions, numeric notation, chmod/chown/chgrp commands, user accounts, root access, sudo, and special permission bits.

### TEXT - Text Processing

Tools for searching and manipulating text including grep, regular expressions, sed, awk, text streams, standard input/output/error, redirection operators, and pipe-based command pipelines.

### EDIT - Text Editors

Terminal-based text editors including Nano for beginners and Vim for power users, covering modes, commands, navigation, and configuration files.

### CONF - Configuration

Shell customization including dotfiles (.bashrc, .zshrc), environment variables (PATH, HOME), aliases, shell functions, and startup scripts.

### PROC - Process Management

Understanding and controlling running programs including process IDs, foreground/background processes, job control, kill signals, cron scheduling, and shell scripting.

### PKG - Package Management

Installing and managing software using package managers like APT (Debian/Ubuntu), Homebrew (macOS), and related package formats.

### NET - Networking

Network fundamentals and remote access including IP addressing, DNS, SSH connections, key-based authentication, firewalls, and network diagnostic tools.

### STOR - Storage and Performance

Disk and file management including compression tools, archive formats, storage devices, mounting, file system types, and system performance monitoring.

### RPI - Raspberry Pi

Raspberry Pi specific topics including hardware models, GPIO programming, sensors, motors, LEDs, IoT projects, and home automation.

### CLOUD - Cloud and Containers

Modern deployment technologies including Docker containers, cloud computing basics, Terraform infrastructure-as-code, and microservices.

### DEV - Development Tools

Software development workflow including Git version control, GitHub, Python programming environment, IDEs, and debugging tools.

### ADMIN - System Administration

System management tasks including user/group management, system services, boot process, display configuration, and audio setup.

### CAP - Capstone Projects

Hands-on final projects and career-related topics including web servers, game servers, media servers, network tools, and Linux career paths.
