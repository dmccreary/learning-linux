## Definition Quality Samples

### Well-Formed Examples

1. **Bash Shell** - "The default command-line interpreter for most Linux distributions, providing scripting and interactive features."

2. **File Permission** - "Access controls that determine who can read, write, or execute a file or directory."

3. **Process ID** - "A unique numerical identifier assigned by the kernel to each running process."

### Definitions Follow Pattern

- **Format:** [Term] is/means [clear description]
- **Example Format:** Practical command or scenario demonstrating usage
- **Length:** 10-25 words per definition

---

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Add Missing Entries**: 10 concepts from the concept list are not yet in the glossary (primarily in Cloud and Containers section)

2. **Consider Cross-References**: Some related terms could link to each other (e.g., "See also" references)

3. **Update Periodically**: As new chapters are written, ensure new concepts are added to the glossary
