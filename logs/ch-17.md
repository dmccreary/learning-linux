### Real-World Case Study: Image Optimization for Web Books

Based on GitHub repository: https://github.com/dmccreary/claude-skills

**Problem Statement:**
- Images in online books are often too large (4MB+)
- Goal: Shrink images >300KB down to approximately 300KB
- Must iterate compression until target size is reached

**Shell Wrapper Script (bk-resize-images):**
- Environment variable validation (BK_HOME)
- Dependency checking (Python 3, Pillow library)
- Color-coded output for user feedback
- Argument forwarding to Python script
- ~70 lines of documented bash code

**Python Compression Tool (compress-images.py):**
- Uses os.walk() to find images >500KB
- Iterative compression with progressive scale factors
- Tries 0.9, 0.8, 0.7... until target size achieved
- EXIF auto-rotation handling
- Backup file creation (.backup extension)
- JPG to PNG format conversion
- Transparency preservation
- Summary statistics output
- ~200 lines of documented Python code
