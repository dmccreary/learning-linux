## Pedagogical Approach

### Tone & Style
- Opening with RTFM joke (explained PG-style)
- Emphasis on self-sufficiency as a valuable skill
- Practical examples throughout
- Cultural references (Moon landing for cal 7 1969)
- Historical Easter egg (1752 calendar switch)

### Content Ordering
Concepts presented in logical groups:
1. **Help Systems First** - Most important skill for independence
   - Man pages (comprehensive docs)
   - --help and help (quick reference)
   - whatis (one-line summary)
   - apropos (discovery)
2. **Output Commands** - Building blocks
   - echo (simple output)
   - printf (formatted output)
3. **Time Commands** - Practical utilities
   - date (with formatting)
   - cal (with fun historical note)
4. **System Information** - Identity and environment
   - uptime (system status)
   - whoami (user identity)
   - hostname (machine identity)
   - uname (OS/kernel info)
   - version info (software versions)

### Engagement Features
- RTFM joke turned into positive lesson
- "Elevator pitch" analogy for whatis
- Echo described as "making the terminal talk"
- Printf as "echo's sophisticated cousin"
- Cal 1752 Easter egg for curious students
- "System Report Script" combining multiple commands
- Comprehensive cheat sheet for reference

### Practical Focus
- Real workflow for finding help (--help first, then man)
- Timestamp format for filenames (practical tip)
- Load average explanation
- Version checking across different programs
- Mini script combining commands at the end

## Notes for Future Iterations

1. Could add info about `tldr` as a modern alternative to man pages
2. The System Information MicroSim would make a great interactive dashboard
3. Consider adding `info` command for GNU documentation
4. Could expand printf section with more real-world formatting examples
