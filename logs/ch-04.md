## Pedagogical Approach

### Tone & Style
- Opening hook: "Everything is a file (No, Really!)"
- City/map metaphor for file system navigation
- "Home Sweet Home" for home directory
- Practical device examples (/dev/null as "black hole")
- Root directory vs root user clarification

### Content Ordering
Concepts presented in logical navigation journey:
1. **Philosophy** - Everything is a file concept
2. **Starting Point** - Root directory (/)
3. **Your Space** - Home directory (~)
4. **Orientation** - Current directory, pwd
5. **Movement** - cd command, parent/child directories
6. **Paths** - Absolute vs relative (crucial concept)
7. **Exploration** - ls command and options
8. **Hidden World** - Dot files and hidden files
9. **System Tour** - Major directories (/bin, /etc, /var, etc.)
10. **Tools** - tree, file, stat commands
11. **Integration** - Pathnames summary
12. **Bonus** - Open command (macOS/Linux)
13. **Practice** - Four hands-on exercises

### Engagement Features
- "Everything is a file" paradigm explained simply
- Comparison table for absolute vs relative paths
- ASCII breakdown of ls -l output
- Quick reference cheat sheet
- Interesting /dev devices explained
- /proc as "window into system's soul"
- Cross-platform open command coverage

### Practical Focus
- Four complete exercises with step-by-step commands
- Real system exploration (look at /etc/hostname)
- Common mistakes addressed (root dir vs root user)
- Tab completion reminder
- Handling spaces in filenames

## Notes for Future Iterations

1. The File System Navigator MicroSim would be excellent for practice
2. Could add `locate` and `find` preview for finding files
3. Consider adding symlinks preview (covered more in later chapter)
4. FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard) could be mentioned as formal spec
