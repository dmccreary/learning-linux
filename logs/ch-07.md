## Highlights

### Tone Adjustments

- "The Bouncer at the File Club" opening metaphor
- Party guest analogy for owner/group/others
- "With Great Power..." Spider-Man reference for root
- "Permission Pro" achievement language

### Key Analogies Used

1. Bouncer = permissions system
2. Party host/friends/strangers = owner/group/others
3. Guest list = group membership
4. Superuser as "all-powerful admin"

### Practical Scenarios

1. Setting up shared project directory (with setgid)
2. Protecting SSH keys (600 permissions)
3. Web server file permissions
4. Making scripts executable

### Security Warnings

- Never use 777 permissions
- Don't stay logged in as root
- sudo logging and accountability
- Setuid security considerations

## Files Modified

- `/docs/chapters/07-permissions/index.md` - Complete chapter content

## Next Steps

1. Generate MicroSims for interactive elements
2. Permission calculator is high priority for this chapter
3. Proceed to Chapter 8 (grep and regex)
