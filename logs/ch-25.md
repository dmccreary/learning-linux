3. **Practical Focus**: Real installation commands and working configurations
4. **Integration Section**: Shows how projects work together as a complete home server
5. **Portfolio Emphasis**: Encourages documentation for college applications/resumes

## Tone and Style

- Maintained informal, enthusiastic tone appropriate for high school students
- Used gaming/entertainment projects to generate excitement
- Included practical motivations ("make you popular with friends")
- Emphasized that every project runs on Raspberry Pi (cost-effective)
- Celebratory closing encouraging continued learning

## Practice Exercises

Four comprehensive exercises:
1. Mini Web Server Challenge (Nginx + portfolio page)
2. Pi-Hole Deep Dive (blocklists, whitelisting, reporting)
3. Multi-Service Integration (3+ services working together)
4. Portfolio Documentation (complete GitHub-ready documentation)

## Notes

- All `<details>` blocks properly formatted without leading spaces/tabs
- Diagram specifications include Bloom Taxonomy levels and learning objectives
- Included legal/ethical warnings (ROM legality, EULA acceptance)
