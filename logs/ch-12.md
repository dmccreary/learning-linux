## Special Sections Added (Per User Request)

### Top History (Single CPU Era)
- Mentioned top was created in 1984 when computers had single CPUs
- Explained how the interface was designed for simpler times
- Press `1` in top to see individual CPU cores (feature added later)

### CPU and GPU Temperature Monitoring
- Linux methods: lm-sensors, /sys/class/thermal
- NVIDIA: nvidia-smi
- AMD: /sys/class/drm
- macOS: osx-cpu-temp, powermetrics

### USB Power Monitoring
- Explained that USB chips can report current usage
- Operating systems often don't display this information
- Commands to access USB power data via /sys

### Expanded Htop Section
- Why htop is awesome (7 reasons)
- Full keyboard command reference
